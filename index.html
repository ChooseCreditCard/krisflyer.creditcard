    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a KrisFlyer-Style Airline Miles Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>An airline miles credit card connected to a program like KrisFlyer lets you earn miles instead of generic rewards or cashback. Whenever you spend on the card, miles are credited to your frequent-flyer account and can later be used for award flights, upgrades or other travel-related redemptions.</p>
      <p>Because the card is tied to a specific airline ecosystem and its partners, the real value comes from how well that network matches your routes, destinations, and cabin preferences, not just the headline earn rate.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>How Spending and Flights Earn KrisFlyer-Style Miles</h2>
      <p>Most airline cards award a base rate of miles on everyday spend, with higher multipliers for certain categories. Airline tickets, travel bookings, foreign-currency transactions and sometimes dining are common bonus categories that help you build miles faster.</p>
      <p>In addition to card spend, flying with the airline or its partners also earns miles based on distance, booking class or ticket price. Combining card spend and regular flying is usually the fastest way to reach meaningful balances and unlock high-value redemptions.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Miles for Flights and Upgrades</h2>
      <p>Miles can normally be redeemed for economy, premium economy, business or first-class award tickets, as well as for upgrades from a paid fare. The number of miles required depends on route, cabin, peak vs off-peak dates and whether you are booking a saver or standard-type award.</p>
      <p>Because long-haul and premium-cabin tickets are expensive in cash terms, these redemptions can deliver substantially higher value per mile than short-haul economy awards. However, award seat availability and carrier-imposed surcharges are crucial factors that affect real-world value.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Extra section: Partners & Alliances -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Using Miles Across Partners and Alliances</h2>
      <p>Airline loyalty programs like KrisFlyer often participate in alliances and bilateral partnerships. That means miles earned on your card may be redeemable across multiple airlines, allowing you to mix operators on a single itinerary or reach destinations beyond the primary carrier’s own network.</p>
      <p>Partner awards can come with different mileage prices and surcharges compared with redemptions on the main airline. Before booking, it is worth checking several route combinations to see which carrier offers the best balance of miles required, taxes and schedule.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Extra section: Value & Trade-Offs -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When an Airline Miles Card Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>Frequent or aspirational travellers — especially those regularly flying long-haul or premium cabins — are most likely to benefit from a KrisFlyer-style card. If you can plan ahead and are flexible on dates, miles can unlock seats that would otherwise be very expensive in cash.</p>
      <p>If you rarely fly on the linked airline or its partners, or you mainly travel on low-cost carriers, a flexible travel-rewards or cashback card may be simpler and more consistent. Airline-specific miles can be powerful, but they work best when your real-world travel lines up with the network.</p>
